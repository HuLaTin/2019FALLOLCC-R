Basically, PUG-REST takes an input list of records in\none of the three PubChem databases (Compound, Substance, and BioAssay) and returns a list of the related records in the same or different\ndatabase. Here, the meaning of the relationship between the input and output records may be specified using an optional parameter. This allows\none to do various tasks, including (but not limited to) looking up:\n- Depositor-provided records (i.e., substances) that are standardized to a given compound.\n- Mixture compounds that contain a given component compound.\n- Stereoisomers/isotopomers of a given compound.\n- Compounds that are tested to be active in a given assay.\n- Compounds that have similar structures to a given compound.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
