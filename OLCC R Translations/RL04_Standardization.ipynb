In R, some options are\nrcdk , ChemmineR and ChemmineOB . In Python, a useful package is RDKit ; in R, we’ll make use of it online\nversion, the Beaker API of ChEMBL (https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/web-services).\n\n## 1. Structure Standardization\n\nPubChem contains more than 200 millions chemical records submitted by hundreds of data contributors.\nThese depositor-provided records are archived in a database called “Substance” and each record in this\ndatabase is called a substance. The records in the Substance database are highly redundant, because\ndifferent data contributors may submit information on the same chemical, independently of each other.\nTherefore, PubChem extracts unique chemical structures from the Substance database through a process\ncalled standardization (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-018-0293-8 ). These unique structures are stored in the Compound database and individaual records in this database is\ncalled “compounds”. To learn more about the PubChem compounds and substances, please read this\nPubChem Blog post (https://go.usa.gov/xVXct (https://go.usa.gov/xVXct)).\nThe code cells below demonstrates the effects of chemical structure standardization.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 1.** Download a list of the SIDs associated with a given CID\nFirst, let’s get a list of SIDs that are associated CID 1174 (uracil).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pugrest <- 'https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug'\npugin <- 'compound/cid/1174'\npugoper <- 'sids'\npugout <- 'txt'\n\nurl <- paste(pugrest,pugin,pugoper,pugout,sep=\"/\")\nsids <- readLines(url)\nlength(sids)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above request returns 300+ substances, all of which are standardized to the same structure (CID 1174).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 2.** Download the structure data for the SIDs\nNow retrieve the depositor-provided structures for the returned substances.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chunk_size <- 50\nnum_chunks <- ceiling(length(sids)/chunk_size)\n\nsdf <- character(0)\nfor(i in seq(num_chunks)) {\n\n print(paste(\"Processing chunk\", i))\n\n idx1 <- chunk_size * (i - 1) + 1\n idx2 <- chunk_size * i\n str_sids <- paste(sids[idx1:min(idx2,length(sids))], collapse=\",\")\n\n url <- paste(\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/substance/sid\",\n str_sids, \"record/sdf\", sep=\"/\")\n sdf <- c(sdf,readLines(url))\n Sys.sleep(0.2)\n}","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"writeLines(sdf,\"uracil_from_sids.sdf\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 3.** Convert the structures in the SDF file into the SMILES strings and identify unique SMILES and their\nfrequencies.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"if (!require(\"BiocManager\", quietly=TRUE)) {\n install.packages(\"BiocManager\", repos=\"https://cloud.r-project.org/\",\n quiet=TRUE, type=\"binary\")\nlibrary(\"BiocManager\")\n}\nif (!require(\"ChemmineR\", quietly=TRUE)) {\n BiocManager::install(\"ChemmineR\",ask=FALSE)\n library(\"ChemmineR\")\n}\nif (!require(\"ChemmineOB\", quietly=TRUE)) {\n BiocManager::install(\"ChemmineOB\",ask=FALSE)\n library(\"ChemmineOB\")\n}\n#help(package=\"ChemmineOB\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"convertFormatFile(\"SDF\",\"CAN\",\"uracil_from_sids.sdf\",\"uracil_from_sids.smi\")\nsmis <- read.table(\"uracil_from_sids.smi\",header=F,sep=\"\\t\")\ntabSMIs <- table(smis[,1])\ntabSMIs <- sort(tabSMIs,decreasing = TRUE)\ntabSMIs","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above output shows that the 300+ SIDs associated with CID 1174 are represented with six different\nSMILES strings.
